# Founders Research Initiative

Founders' Spring 2021 Research Initiative. Dedicated to answering big questions in the entrepreneurship community and influencing future R&D projects.

## Getting Started

First, make sure that you have all necessary packages installed.

Navigate to the root directory of this project in a terminal, and (assuming you have python3 installed), enter the following:

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

This will install all necessary packages, including **Jupyter**, which will be where we do most of our data analysis.

To start a new Jupyter window, simply type the following into a terminal:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

This will start a new Jupyter session.
